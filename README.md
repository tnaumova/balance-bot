### About and Reasoning

This repo contains solution for the [assignment](assignment.txt). The input file is located in [input.txt](src/main/resources/input.txt)

Although the problem is not very complex, I tried to approach it like an actual project for presentation purposes.
The goal was code and logic should be readable and are open to changes and extensions.
Also, I added some unit tests as I would in the real case; this also helped me to develop the solution.

To Run the solution:

```
   sbt "runMain Main"
```
